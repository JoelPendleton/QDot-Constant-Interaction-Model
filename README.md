# Quantum Dot Constant Interaction Model Simulation
Software to simulate single quantum dot systems, using the constant interaction model.

**Simulation.py** generates coulomb diamonds for 1000 randomised single quantum dot systems, and it also outputs the respective edges of each diamond. 
This code was developed to generate training data for an edge detector, which could be further utilised to perform automated read-outs of the paramters of coulomb diamonds.
